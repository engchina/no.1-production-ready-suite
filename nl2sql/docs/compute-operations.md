# NL2SQL on OCI Compute — runtime and operations

The Compute instance for NL2SQL is created by the suite-wide OCI Resource
Manager stack. For the stack itself (product selection, the shared Autonomous
AI Database, form inputs, packaging, and releases), see
[`terraform/README.md`](../../terraform/README.md) (#217).

This page covers what runs on the NL2SQL Compute instance and how to operate it.
The Resource Manager inputs for NL2SQL are prefixed with `nl2sql_`
(for example `nl2sql_app_admin_login_user_password` and
`nl2sql_oracle_deepsec_enabled`).

## Runtime Notes

The bootstrap script writes `/u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/nl2sql/backend/.env`
on the instance and starts in the background from cloud-init, matching the
proven No.1-SQL-Assist Terraform bootstrap pattern. Track progress in
`/var/log/cloud-init-custom.log` and `/var/log/nl2sql-init.log` until the
application services are ready.
The bootstrap starts:

- Nginx on the configured application port, default `80`
- `production-ready-nl2sql-backend` on private upstream `127.0.0.1:8000`

Nginx serves `frontend/dist` at `/` and reverse proxies `/api/` to the backend.
Only TCP `80` needs to be opened publicly for the application. If ADB uses a
private endpoint, the selected network must still allow Compute to reach ADB on
TCP `1522`.

The bootstrap applies the core system schema and application security/RBAC
migrations idempotently. When both commands succeed, it enables and starts the
schema refresh, quality evaluation, and ontology workers. If either command
still fails after retries, the backend and Nginx remain available in degraded
mode and all three workers stay stopped. The affected settings/security page
shows a recoverable initialization error instead of an unhandled Oracle error.

After completing the manual recovery commands in the troubleshooting section,
operators can enable the workers with:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-schema-refresh-worker
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-quality-evaluation-worker
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-ontology-worker
```

The configured `SYSTEM_ADMIN` login comes from the application administrator
values supplied in Resource Manager:

- `APP_ADMIN_LOGIN_USER_ID=system_admin`
- `APP_ADMIN_LOGIN_USER_PASSWORD`

Deep Data Security is enabled by default in Terraform deployments. If
`nl2sql_oracle_deepsec_enabled=false`, `ORACLE_DEEPSEC_ENABLED=false` and the DATA USER
password is written empty:

- `ORACLE_DEEPSEC_ENABLED` (`true` by default)
- `ORACLE_DEEPSEC_DATA_USER=DEEPSEC_DATA_USER`
- `ORACLE_DEEPSEC_DATA_USER_PASSWORD`

After deployment, open `システム設定 > Deep Data Security`, apply the V001 steps in
order, then run the Data Grant verification.

The stack reserves a fixed Oracle Select AI credential name and the default
Select AI region:

- `NL2SQL_SELECT_AI_CREDENTIAL_NAME=OCI_CRED`
- `NL2SQL_SELECT_AI_REGION=us-chicago-1`

After deployment, open `システム設定 > データベース設定 > Select AI Credential`.
The administrator explicitly creates `OCI_CRED` for the current Oracle schema
from the server-side OCI config signing key. The private key is passed to
`DBMS_CLOUD.CREATE_CREDENTIAL` only as an Oracle bind variable; Terraform,
browser responses, and persisted application settings never receive it. An
existing credential is not overwritten automatically and requires the explicit
recreate confirmation flow. Historical Profile sync jobs are not retried
automatically after credential creation.

This configured administrator is independent from the database connection user,
does not read from `PLATFORM_USERS`, and does not require the auth/RBAC tables
to exist. Application-local users are checked from `PLATFORM_USERS`. The
configured administrator password can be changed from the application password
change screen; the backend writes the new value back to `backend/.env`.

When `adb_deployment_mode` selects an existing ADB (`既存の Autonomous AI
Database を選択`, or legacy `USE_EXISTING`), the stack does not create any ADB
resource. It generates a wallet from the selected existing ADB OCID and writes the
database values into `backend/.env`:

- `ORACLE_USER`
- `ORACLE_PASSWORD`
- `ORACLE_DSN` (`existing_oracle_dsn`, or `<selected ADB db_name lowercased>_high`
  when left blank)
- `ORACLE_CONNECTION_SECURITY` (`wallet_mtls` when mTLS is required,
  otherwise `walletless_tls`)
- `ORACLE_WALLET_PASSWORD` (reuses `existing_oracle_password`)
- `ORACLE_ADB_OCID`
- `ORACLE_ADB_REGION`

The Resource Manager form hides the application environment and auth cookie
security inputs. Direct HTTP deployments keep the internal defaults
`nl2sql_app_environment=local`, `DEBUG=false`, and `nl2sql_app_auth_cookie_secure=false`.
If you override these Terraform variables outside the form for HTTPS, use
`nl2sql_app_environment=production` with `nl2sql_app_auth_cookie_secure=true`.

## Updating an Existing Compute Deployment

After manually pulling the required repositories, run the post-pull update
script as the `ubuntu` user when passwordless sudo is available. The script uses
only non-interactive `sudo -n` and never prompts for the `ubuntu` password. If
the instance does not grant passwordless sudo, start the script through an
existing root-capable path with `sudo ./scripts/update-after-pull.sh`. In root
mode, dependency synchronization, frontend builds, and database CLIs are still
executed as `ubuntu`; only systemd, snapshots, logging, and permission repair
retain root privileges. The script does not run Git commands and does not
rewrite `backend/.env`, the Wallet contents, systemd units, or the Nginx
configuration.

```bash
cd /u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/nl2sql
./scripts/update-after-pull.sh --check
./scripts/update-after-pull.sh --repair-only
./scripts/update-after-pull.sh
```

Without passwordless sudo, use the root-launch form instead; these commands do
not make the build output root-owned:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/update-after-pull.sh --check
sudo ./scripts/update-after-pull.sh --repair-only
sudo ./scripts/update-after-pull.sh
```

`--check` only inspects the fixed paths, Wallet and `.env` permissions, systemd
units, and system schema status. It does not create a lock, log, snapshot, stop a
service, or run a migration. `--repair-only` skips dependency synchronization
and frontend building, then snapshots and repairs the deployed instance,
applies migrations, and restores services. With no arguments, the script first
synchronizes and compile-checks the backend and builds the shared UI and NL2SQL
frontend into a staging directory while the current services remain available.
Only after those steps succeed does it enter the maintenance window.

Before stopping services, mutating modes create a root-only snapshot below
`/u01/aipoc/recovery`. They then enforce `/u01/aipoc` as `root:ubuntu 0775`,
`/u01/aipoc/wallet` as `ubuntu:ubuntu 0700`, and Wallet files, the install lock,
and `backend/.env` as `0600`. `ORACLE_WALLET_DIR` remains fixed at
`/u01/aipoc/wallet`; the `.env` file is parsed without sourcing secret values.
System and security migrations are idempotent. The script never deletes
`.wallet.tmp-*` or `.wallet.backup-*`, never recreates the schema, and never
applies the administrator-confirmed DeepSec foundation plan.

If a migration, backend health check, or worker restart fails, all external
workers are disabled and the script makes a best-effort attempt to restore the
backend. The existing `frontend/dist` remains active. In a full update, the new
frontend is promoted only after the backend is healthy and every service is
active. If the final public/Nginx health check fails, the previous frontend is
restored while the successfully initialized backend and workers remain running.
The command log is appended to `/var/log/nl2sql-update.log`.

The shared platform defaults to `platform/` in the same suite checkout
(`/u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/platform`). For a nonstandard installation,
override `PLATFORM_REPO_DIR`. `BACKEND_HEALTH_URL`, `PUBLIC_HEALTH_URL`,
`HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, and `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` are also
available for nondefault ports or health-check timing.

## Troubleshooting

### Live application logs

`scripts/tail-logs.sh` is a read-only viewer that merges the four
`production-ready-nl2sql-*` units and the `/var/log` files into one stream and
renders the backend's JSON log lines in human-readable form. It never restarts
or otherwise mutates a service. Run it on the Compute instance:

```bash
cd /u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/nl2sql
./scripts/tail-logs.sh --status          # unit state + backend/public health check
./scripts/tail-logs.sh                   # follow the four application units
./scripts/tail-logs.sh --backend         # backend only
./scripts/tail-logs.sh --all             # units + Nginx + init/update logs
./scripts/tail-logs.sh --level ERROR --since "-15 min" --no-follow
```

`--help` lists every option (`--workers`, `--unit`, `--nginx`, `--init`,
`--update`, `--lines`, `--grep`, `--raw`). It falls back to `sudo` automatically
when journald is not readable as the current user; if that fails, rerun with
`sudo ./scripts/tail-logs.sh`.

The equivalent manual commands, and everything the script does not cover:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-custom.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nl2sql-init.log
cd /u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/nl2sql
sudo systemctl status production-ready-nl2sql-backend
sudo journalctl -u production-ready-nl2sql-backend -f
sudo journalctl -u production-ready-nl2sql-schema-refresh-worker -f
sudo journalctl -u production-ready-nl2sql-quality-evaluation-worker -f
sudo journalctl -u production-ready-nl2sql-ontology-worker -f
sudo nginx -t
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/production-ready-nl2sql-error.log
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
curl -i http://127.0.0.1/api/health
curl -i http://127.0.0.1/health
```

### Validate an updated or repaired Compute instance

After a successful update or repair, validate with relative UTC time instead of
converting the browser timestamp manually:

```bash
sudo systemctl --no-pager --full status \
  production-ready-nl2sql-backend.service \
  production-ready-nl2sql-schema-refresh-worker.service \
  production-ready-nl2sql-quality-evaluation-worker.service \
  production-ready-nl2sql-ontology-worker.service
sudo journalctl \
  -u production-ready-nl2sql-backend.service \
  -u production-ready-nl2sql-schema-refresh-worker.service \
  --since "-15 min" --no-pager -o short-iso
```

Then confirm Wallet refresh, application user management, the pending DeepSec
V001 plan, and completion of any previously pending schema refresh job from the
UI. Docker is not part of this recovery path, and OCI SDK circuit-breaker INFO
messages are not failures.

For the permanent Resource Manager rollout, publish the fixed application with
an immutable `application_git_ref` and create a replacement Compute instance.
Updating `user_data` metadata on an already booted instance does not rerun
cloud-init. Keep the repaired old instance until the replacement passes the same
health/UI checks, and migrate `/u01/data/production-ready-nl2sql` before cutover
when it contains local documents or settings.

The cloud-init bootstrap:

1. Installs Nginx, Node.js 24, uv, and build dependencies.
2. Clones the suite monorepo (NL2SQL and the shared platform) once.
3. Extracts the ADB wallet to `/u01/aipoc/wallet`.
4. Writes the runtime `backend/.env`.
5. Installs backend dependencies with `uv sync --locked --no-dev --python 3.12`.
6. Keeps `/u01/aipoc/wallet` at `ubuntu:ubuntu 0700` with files at `0600`, and
   sets `/u01/aipoc` to `root:ubuntu 0775` for Wallet install locks and atomic
   temporary/backup directories.
7. Runs `nl2sql_system_schema --initialize` and
   `app_security_migrate --apply --skip-bootstrap` with retries.
8. Builds the shared UI package and `frontend/dist`.
9. Starts the backend service with systemd and starts external workers only
   when both schema commands succeeded.
10. Configures Nginx to serve the SPA and same-origin `/api/` path.

This Resource Manager deployment is a direct systemd + Nginx installation.
Docker is not installed or required on the Compute instance.

Node.js installation uses the NodeSource apt repository first. If apt candidate
inspection, installation, or post-install validation fails, the init script
falls back to the official Node.js `latest-v24.x` Linux tarball with
`SHASUMS256.txt` verification. Override `NODEJS_OFFICIAL_RELEASE_BASE_URL` or
`NODEJS_OFFICIAL_INSTALL_DIR` only for controlled mirrors or recovery testing;
`NODEJS_OFFICIAL_BIN_DIR` is also available when the symlink target must be
isolated.

Backend startup remains independent of database reachability and table
existence. The bootstrap tries both migrations first, but if the database is not
ready yet the application still starts in degraded mode. Check
`/var/log/nl2sql-init.log` for `WARNING: Continuing in degraded mode`, then run:

```bash
cd /u01/aipoc/no.1-production-ready-suite/nl2sql/backend
sudo -u ubuntu /usr/local/bin/uv run python -m app.cli.nl2sql_system_schema --initialize
sudo -u ubuntu /usr/local/bin/uv run python -m app.cli.app_security_migrate --apply --skip-bootstrap
sudo systemctl restart production-ready-nl2sql-backend
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-schema-refresh-worker
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-quality-evaluation-worker
sudo systemctl enable --now production-ready-nl2sql-ontology-worker
```

The security migration creates `NL2SQL_DEEPSEC_MIGRATIONS`, allowing the Deep
Data Security page to show the pending V001 foundation plan. The bootstrap does
not apply those administrator-confirmed DeepSec foundation steps automatically.
